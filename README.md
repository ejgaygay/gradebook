<h1><b>Gradebook</b></h1>
<p>
Welcome to Gradebook, a program that essentially functions as your own little personal gradebook for a class!
</p>
<h2><b>Motivation:</b></h2>

<p>
Some teachers are really bad at updating grades in their own gradebook for their students. This program gives users the ability to do that! Now, I know that an excel sheet is, in every way, better than my program :( ;however, I was bored and decided to try to learn git and github and hone my coding skills while learning about documentation reading. I made it my purpose of committing and pushing to git and github often so that I engrave it into my brain. I also wanted to learn about creating GUIs in my favorite language while learning how to navigate the web and read documentation in order to solve my own problems along this journey. As of (12/16/21), this program is unfinished, however I do hope that one day this whole thing grows to become something really cool. Anyways, thanks for reading this long <p></p> and below, you'll see some of the (potential) features and technologies of this app. See you around!
